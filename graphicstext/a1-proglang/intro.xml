<p1>This appendix contains brief introductions to three programming languages that are used in the
textbook: Java, C, and JavaScript.   You should be very familiar with at least one of the
three languages before reading this textbook.  The three languages have something in common, so that
knowing one will make it easier to learn the others.  You should also be at least somewhat 
familiar with classes, objects, and object-oriented programming.</p1>

<p>The appendix is meant to help you 
get started with the languages that you don't already know.  Only some basic information about each
language is given&mdash;but hopefully enough to let you understand examples in the
book and to write some programs that use the graphics techniques that are covered.
You should at least be able to work with the sample programs that accompany this textbook.</p>

<p>Java is obligatory only for <localref href="graphics2d.5"/>.  For the material on
<word>OpenGL</word>&nbsp;1.1 in <localref href="gl1geom"/> and <localref href="gl1light"/>, 
either Java or C can be used.  Or, if you prefer JavaScript, you can use my glsim.js
(<localref href="gl1geom.6.3"/>), a JavaScript library that simulates a large part of OpenGL&nbsp;1.1.
But in any case, you will need to be at least somewhat familiar with
C to follow the discussion.  The <word>shader</word> programming language that is used
with <word>WebGL</word> is based on C, so some knowledge of C will also be useful
there.  (However, for writing WebGL shaders, you will not need to know one of the most
confusing aspects of C, namely the details of how it uses pointers).
JavaScript is essential for <word>WebGL</word> programming (<localref href="webgl"/> and <localref href="webgl3d"/>), 
for programming with <word>three.js</word> (<localref href="threejs"/>), and
for WebGPU (<localref href="webgpu"/>).  It is also used for
<word>HTML canvas</word> graphics in <localref href="graphics2d.6"/>.</p>
