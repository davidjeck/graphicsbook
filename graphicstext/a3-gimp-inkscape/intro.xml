<p1>Gimp and Inkscape are free and open-source programs for creating and
manipulating two-dimensional images.  Gimp is a <word>painting program</word>;
that is, it is primarily concerned with setting the colors of individual
pixels in an image.  Inkscape is a <word>drawing program</word>; that is,
it represents an image as a data structure that contains information
about the objects in a 2D scene.  The difference between painting and
drawing is discussed in <localref href="introduction.1"/>.

<p>Even though the main focus of this book is on programming for three-dimensional
graphics, it can be useful to get some experience with 2D image manipulation programs.
Such programs illustrate some important concepts, such as color manipulation,
transparency, shape creation and editing, <word term="Bezier curve">Bezier curves</word>,
and (in drawing programs) grouping graphical objects into hierarchical structures.  And the
programs are often useful even in 3D graphics, for working with <word>texture</word> images.
This appendix offers just a very brief introduction to Gimp and Inkscape, but maybe
enough to let you start experimenting with the programs and to inspire you to learn more
about them from other sources.</p>

<p>When I taught computer graphics, I often included a few labs on Gimp and Inkscape. The material 
in this appendix was adapted from those labs.  While Gimp and Inkscape
are not quite the equivalent of the commercial programs Photoshop and Illustrator, they are
free, they can be used in serious graphics projects, and they have far more features than
can be covered in a couple of labs.</p>
