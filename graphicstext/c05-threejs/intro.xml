<p1><localref href="gl1geom"/> and <localref href="gl1light"/> introduced 3D graphics 
using <word>OpenGL</word>&nbsp;1.1.  Most of the ideas covered in those chapters remain relevant to modern
computer graphics, but there have been many changes and improvements since the early
days of OpenGL.  In <localref href="webgl"/> and <localref href="webgl3d"/>, we will be using <word>WebGL</word>,
a modern version of OpenGL that is used to create 3D graphics content for web pages.
And <localref href="webgpu"/> introduces <word>WebGPU</word>, a newer graphics <word>API</word> for the Web.</p1>

<p>WebGL is a low level language&mdash;even more so than OpenGL 1.1, since a WebGL program
has to handle a lot of the low-level implementation details that were handled internally
in the original version of OpenGL.  This makes WebGL much more flexible, but more difficult
to use.  We will soon turn to working
directly with WebGL.  However, before we do that, we will look
at a higher-level API for 3D web graphics that is built on top of WegGL:  
<i><newword>three.js</newword></i>.  There are several reasons for starting at this high level.
It will allow you to see how some of the things that you have learned are used in
a modern object-oriented graphics package.  It will allow me to introduce some new features such as
shadows and environment mapping.  It will let you work with a graphics library that
you might use in real web applications.
And it will be a break from the low-level detail we have been dealing with, before
we move on to an even lower level.</p>

<p>You can probably follow much of the discussion in this chapter without knowing 
JavaScript.  However, if you want to do any programming with <i>three.js</i> (or with 
WebGL or WebGPU), you need to know JavaScript.  The basics of the language are covered in
<localref href="proglang.3"/> in <localref href="proglang"/>.</p>
