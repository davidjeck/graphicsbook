<p1>This textbook represents my attempt to develop a one-semester first course in
computer graphics, which would typically be taken by a computer science student
in the third or fourth year of college.  (How long it will continue to be appropriate 
is an open question, given the always-rapid changes in the field of computer graphics.)
I have tried to make the book suitable for self-learning as well.</p1>

<p>A reader of this book should have substantial experience
with at least one programming language, including some knowledge of object-oriented
programming and data structures.  Everyone taking my own computer graphics course
had at least two semesters of programming, and most had additional experience
beyond that.  My students studied the Java programming language, but
the book should also be accessible to people with background in other languages.
Examples in the book use JavaScript, Java, and&nbsp;C. 
It is possible to do all the programming in JavaScript, but some
knowledge of C is also important for certain sections of the book.
The essential features of
the three programming languages are covered in an appendix.  (If you need to learn programming
from the beginning, try my free introductory Java textbook, which is available at
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes">http://math.hws.edu/javanotes</a>.)</p>

<p>I used Version 1.0 of this book for a course in Fall 2015.
Version 1.1 corrected some errors and typos and added some material.
It was used in the Fall 2017 version of my course.  Version&nbsp;1.3,
which I used in Fall 2021, added some material on WebGL&nbsp;2.0 and GLSL&nbsp;ES&nbsp;3.00,
updated most of the JavaScript code to use ES6, and updated Chapter&nbsp;5
to use Release 129 of the <i>three.js</i> library.</p>

<p>Although I have retired from teaching, I decided to work on Version 1.4 in Summer 2023.
I added a new chapter on WebGPU and moved to Release 154 for <i>three.js</i>.
Because WebGPU uses JavaScript promises, I added a new section to Appendix&nbsp;A to
cover promises and async functions.  Because <i>three.js</i> will soon remove the
non-modular version of the library, I added a short section on JavaScript modules at the
start of Chapter&nbsp;5, and I modified the <i>three.js</i> examples to use modules.
Except for the move to modular <i>three.js</i>, the material in Chapter&nbsp;5
has not changed.  Many typos and small errors have been fixed throughout the book.
(Thanks to a reader, Danny Hurlburt, for fixing many of those.)</p>

<p>Many of the sample programs for this book are actually Web pages meant to be viewed
in a Web browser.  The Web version of this book includes interactive demo programs that are integrated
into the Web pages that make up the book.</p>

<p>Most sample programs and all demos use HTML canvas graphics (in Chapter 2),
WebGPU (in Chapter&nbsp;9), or WebGL
(in other chapters).  Canvas graphics and WebGL should work well in almost any modern browser.
WebGPU is a new technology and is more problematic.  In July 2023, it is available
by default in only a few Web browsers (Chrome and Edge on Windows and MacOS), and even on
those it might not work on all hardware.  In some other browsers, it can be enabled
as an experimental feature.  However, WebGPU is very likely to be the future of
3D graphics on the Web, so it is important to start learning it.</p>

<p>The sample programs and demos can all be found in the download of the web site
version of this book, which is available from <web>its
<a href="index.html">main page</a></web><tex>the main page of its web site</tex>.
Look for them in the
folders named <i>source</i> and <i>demo</i>.  Note that most Web browsers are
not willing to use certain resources from the local file system, such as 
3D models and modular JavaScript scripts.  Those browsers will have
errors when they try to run some of the samples locally instead of over the Web.
This issue affects only some of the examples.  For those examples, you can use an
on-line version of the book.  Another solution is to run a web server on your own
computer and view the textbook through that web server.  It might be possible to
configure your Web browser to use resources from local files, although it might
not be a good idea to browse the Web with that configuration.</p>

<p>I taught computer graphics every couple of years or so
over a period of almost 35 years.  As the field
developed, I had to make major changes almost every time I taught the course, but for
much of that time, I was able to structure the course primarily around OpenGL&nbsp;1.1,
a graphics API that was in common use for an extended period.  OpenGL&nbsp;1.1 implements
fundamental graphics concepts&mdash;vertices, normal vectors, coordinate transformations,
lighting, and material&mdash;in a way that is transparent and fairly easy to use.  Newer
graphics APIs are more flexible and more powerful, but they have a much steeper learning
curve.  I&nbsp;believe that any introductory computer science course benefits from starting
with a simpler framework or library, and OpenGL 1.1 serves that purpose well.</p>

<p>OpenGL is still
widely supported, but, for various reasons, the parts of it that were easy to use have been 
officially dropped from the latest versions (although they are in practice supported 
on most desktop computers). Furthermore, OpenGL is largely being superceded by newer
graphics APIs such as Direct3D, Metal, and Vulkan.  WebGL is based on OpenGL, and it
will continue to be widely supported for some time.  WebGPU is inspired by the
newer APIs, and may at some point replace WebGL for new applications.</p>

<p>My approach in this book is to use a subset of OpenGL 1.1 as the framework for introducing
the fundamental
concepts of three-dimensional graphics.  I then go on to cover WebGL, the version of OpenGL
that runs in a web browser.  In the last chapter, I introduce WebGPU.
While OpenGL makes up the major foundation for the course, the real emphasis is on fundamental
concepts such as geometric modeling and transformations; hierarchical modeling and scene graphs;
color, lighting, and textures; and animation.  I continue to believe that OpenGL 1.1 makes
a good introduction to this material.</p>

<p><i>Chapter&nbsp;1</i> is a short overview of computer graphics.  It introduces many concepts
that will be covered in much more detail in the rest of the book.</p>

<p><i>Chapter&nbsp;2</i> covers two-dimensional graphics in Java, JavaScript, and SVG, with an 
emphasis on ideas such as transformations and scene graphs that carry over to
three dimensions.</p>

<p><i>Chapter&nbsp;3</i> and <i>Chapter&nbsp;4</i> cover OpengGL 1.1.  While OpenGL 1.1 is fairly
primitive by today's standard, it includes many basic features that are still fundamental to
three-dimensional computer graphics. Only part of the API is covered.</p>

<p><i>Chapter&nbsp;5</i> covers <i>three.js</i>, a higher-level object-oriented
3D graphics API for Web graphics
using JavaScript.  This chapter shows how fundamental concepts can be used in a higher-level
interface.</p>

<p><i>Chapter&nbsp;6</i> and <i>Chapter&nbsp;7</i> cover WebGL, a modern version of OpenGL for
graphics on the Web.  WebGL is very low-level, and it requires the programmer to write
"shader programs" to implement many features that are built into OpenGL&nbsp;1.1. Looking
at the implementation is an opportunity to understand more deeply how computers actually
make 3D images.</p>

<p><i>Chapter&nbsp;8</i> looks very briefly at some advanced techniques that are not possible in
OpenGL.</p>

<p>And <i>Chapter 9</i> is an introduction to WebGPU, the newest API for graphics on the Web.</p>

<p><i>Appendix A</i> contains brief introductions to three programming languages that are
used in the book: Java, C, and JavaScript.  <i>Appendix&nbsp;B</i> is meant to get readers started
with the most basic uses of Blender, a sophisticated 3D modeling program.  I have found that
introducing students to Blender is a good way to help them develop their three-dimensional
intuition.  <i>Appendix&nbsp;C</i> contains even briefer introductions to two 2D graphics
programs, Gimp and Inkscape.</p>
