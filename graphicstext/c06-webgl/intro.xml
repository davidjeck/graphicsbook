<p1>In this chapter, we turn to <newword>WebGL</newword>, the version of <word>OpenGL</word>
for the Web.  <i>Three.js</i>, which was covered in the <localref href="threejs">previous chapter</localref>,
uses WebGL for 3D graphics.  Of course, it is more difficult to use WebGL directly, but doing
so gives you full control over the graphics hardware.  And learning it will be a good introduction
to modern graphics programming.  WebGL is very different from OpenGL&nbsp;1.1, which we 
studied in <localref href="gl1geom"/> and <localref href="gl1light"/>.  Nevertheless,
it will turn out that much of what you learned in previous chapters will carry over to
WebGL. </p1>

<p>It is not my intention to cover WebGL in its entirety.  There are many WebGL features
that I will not even mention, and many of those are important for more advanced computer
graphics.  However, I will cover the core features that are needed for 2D and 3D graphics,
along with a few of the more advanced aspects, as a bonus.</p>

<p>There are two versions of WebGL, both of them still in use.  WebGL 1.0 is based on 
OpenGL ES 2.0, a version of OpenGL designed for use on embedded systems such as 
smart phones and tablets.  OpenGL ES 1.0, the original OpenGL for embedded systems,
was very similar to OpenGL&nbsp;1.1.  However, the 2.0 version of OpenGL&nbsp;ES introduced
major changes.  It is actually a smaller, simpler <word>API</word> that puts more responsibility
on the programmer.  For example, functions for working with transformations, such
as <i>glRotatef</i> and <i>glPushMatrix</i>, were eliminated from the API, making the
programmer responsible for keeping track of transformations.  WebGL does not
use <i>glBegin/glEnd</i> to generate geometry, and it doesn't use function such
as <i>glColor*</i> or <i>glNormal*</i> to specify attributes of vertices. 
WebGL 1.0 is supported in almost every web browser.  (On some devices, WebGL might
be disabled because of hardware limitations.)</p>

<p>WebGL 2.0, which is based on OpenGL ES 3.0, is now supported on almost all devices that
suport WebGL&nbsp;1.0.  Most programs written for WebGL&nbsp;1.0 will
also work under WebGL&nbsp;2.0, so almost everything that you learn about the 1.0 version
will carry over to the newer version.  In this textbook, I will concentrate on WebGL&nbsp;1.0,
but I will also cover some of the new features of WebGL&nbsp;2.0.
I will try to make it clear when I am talking about features that only apply to WebGL&nbsp;2.0.</p>

<p>There are two sides to any WebGL program.  Part of the program is written in
<word>JavaScript</word>, the programming language for the web. The second part is
written in <word>GLSL</word>, a language for writing "shader" programs that run on the
<word>GPU</word>.  WebGL&nbsp;1.0 uses GLSL ES 1.00 (the
OpenGL Shader Language for Embedded Systems, version 1.00).  WebGL&nbsp;2.0 can use shader
programs written in GLSL ES 1.00, but it can also use GLSL ES 3.00, which has some
significant differences as well as new features.  I will try to always be clear about 
which language I am discussing.</p>

<p>For this introductory chapter about WebGL, we will stick to basic 
2D graphics.  You will learn about the structure of WebGL programs.  You will learn
most of the JavaScript side of the API, and you will learn how to write and use simple
shaders.  In the <localref href="webgl3d">next chapter</localref>, we will move
on to 3D graphics, and you will learn a great deal more about GLSL.</p>
