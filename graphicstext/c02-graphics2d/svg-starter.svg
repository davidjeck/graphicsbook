<!-- This document shows a possible structure for an SVG document,
and it contains examples of basic shapes, attributes, and transforms. 
The "?xml" and "DOCTYPE" lines, above, and the first line of the "<svg>"
tag, below, should always appear as shown.  The second line of
the svg tag is only necessary if the document contains "use" elements.
   The width and height in the next line give the preferred size for the
image when it is displayed. The viewbox defines the coordinate system
used for drawing on the image, in the format  x y width height.  (x,y) are
the coordinates for the upper left corner of the image, horizontal
coordinates range from x to x+width, and vertical coordinates range
from y to y+height; the width and height must be positive.  The
content of the svg element, everything from the <svg> tag to the 
closing </svg> tag, specifies the scene in the image.
   The value for preserveAspectRatio shown here is the default.  If
the actual aspect ratio of the rectangle that holds the image when 
it is displayed does not match the aspect ratio of the viewBox, then the
viewBox limits are extended either horizontally or vertically to match
the aspect ratio of the viewBox, and the requested viewBox occupies the 
center of the display rectangle.  If the value of preserveAspectRatio
is set to "none", then the viewBox limits will be kept as given, and
the image will be stretched to fill the display rectangle.
