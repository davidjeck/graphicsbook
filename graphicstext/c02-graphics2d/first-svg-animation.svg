<!-- A first example of animation shows trees that
     grows during the period from 3 seconds to 20
     seconds after the image loads.  It also uses
     keyframe animation to move a disk around the
     edge of a square.  A black square moves across
     the bottom of the image repeatedly. -->
     
     

<!-- A back square with an animated x attribute transform to make
     it move along the bottom of the picture.  The animation takes
     7 seconds and repeats forever. -->

<!-- A keyframe animation.  The cx and cy properties of a circle are
     animated to make its center move around the edge of a rect. 
     For cx, the value goes from 30 to 170 in the first 1/4 of the
     animation, then stays equal to 170 for the second quarter,
     then decreases from 170 to 30 in the third quarter, and stays
     fixed at 30 in the final quarter.  cy is similar.  The
     animation lasts 4 second and will repeat indefinitely.
     Note that the cx and cy attributes on the circle element will
     only be used when animation is not supported.-->

<!-- A "tree" made of a rectangle and a triangle.  This tree has
     the center of its base at (0,0) and its tip at (0,200).  In 
     the default coordinate system, it is pointed downwards.
     A scale(1,-1) flips it vertically, so that its tip is now
     at (0,-200) with the base still at (0,0).  This lies
     outside the view rectangle, so I need to translate it
     by 200 vertically to get it back inside the view rect.
     The tip is then at (0,0) and the  base at (0,200).  But
     I also translate it by 400 horizontally, moving the base
     to (400,200) and the tip to (0,0).  -->

     The fill="freeze" makes it keep the final value after the animation
