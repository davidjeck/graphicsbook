<p1>One of the goals of computer graphics is physical realism, that is, making
images that look like they could be photographs of reality.  This is not the only 
goal.  For example, for scientific visualization, the goal is to use computer 
graphics to present information accurately and clearly.  Artists can use computer
graphics to create abstract rather than realistic art.  However, realism is a
major goal of some of the most visible uses of computer graphics, such as video
games, movies, and advertising.</p1>

<p>One important aspect of physical realism is <word>lighting</word>:
the play of light and shadow, the way that light reflects from different 
<word term="material">materials</word>, the
way it can bend or be diffracted as it passes through translucent
objects.  The techniques that are used to produce the most realistic graphics
can take all these factors and more into account.</p>

<p>However, another goal of computer graphics is <i>speed</i>.  OpenGL, in particular,
was designed for <newword>real-time graphics</newword>, where the time that is available
for rendering an image is a fraction of a second.  For an animated movie, it's OK if
it takes hours to <word term="rendering">render</word> each frame.  But a video game is expected to
render sixty frames every second.  Even with the incredible speed of modern computer graphics
hardware, compromises are necessary to get that speed.  And thirty years ago, when OpenGL
was still new, the compromises were a lot bigger</p>

<p>In this chapter, we look at light and material in OpenGL 1.1.   You will learn how to
configure light sources and how to assign material properties to objects.  Material properties determine how
the objects interact with light.  And you will learn how to apply an image to a surface
as a <word>texture</word>.  The support for light, material, and texture in OpenGL 1.1
is relatively crude and incomplete, by today's standards.  But the concepts that it uses
still serve as the foundation for modern real-time graphics and, to a significant extent,
even for the most realistic computer graphics.</p>
